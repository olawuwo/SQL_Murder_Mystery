# SQL_Murder_Mystery Solution

This is my solution to [The SQL Murder Mystery game](https://mystery.knightlab.com/). Using my SQL expertise, I've delved into the tables within the database to unravel the mystery behind the crime. You can find my detailed approach and solution in the [approach](approach.md) file.

I employed the use of SELECT, JOIN and WHERE to solve the question. Feels free to let me know if you have any question.

My approach and strategy primarily involved leveraging SQL commands such as SELECT, JOIN, and WHERE to extract the necessary information and piece together the puzzle of the crime.
